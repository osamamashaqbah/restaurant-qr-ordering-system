This is the Angular frontend for the ASP.NET Core rewrite. It was generated
using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 22.1.5.

## Runtime configuration

Copy the Supabase project URL and anon key into `public/runtime-config.js` for
local or deployed staff authentication. The anon key is a public client key;
never put the Supabase database password or service-role key in this file.

The ASP.NET API separately requires `ConnectionStrings__SupabaseDatabase`,
`Supabase__JwtIssuer`, and `Supabase__JwtSecret` as server-side settings.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
npm test -- --watch=false
```
